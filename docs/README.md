# OctoAcme Project Management Process Guide

Welcome to OctoAcme! This README provides a brief overview of how we manage projects, enabling new team members to quickly understand our workflows, roles, communication practices, and quality standards. For detailed information on specific topics, please refer to the linked process documents throughout this guide.

## How We Run Projects

Project management at OctoAcme follows a structured lifecycle designed to deliver customer value iteratively while maintaining transparency and accountability. Every project begins with a clear **initiation process** ([see Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)) that validates business needs, aligns stakeholders, and creates foundational artifacts like the Project One-pager. This one-pager captures the problem statement, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, timeline, and initial risks—ensuring everyone shares a common understanding before work begins. Once an initiative is approved, we move into **planning** ([see Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)), where we break down work into prioritized backlogs with clear acceptance criteria, estimate scope using story points or T-shirt sizing, and manage risks through a Risk Register and milestone maps. Our planning also defines the Definition of Done and identifies cross-team dependencies to minimize surprises during execution.

## Roles, Responsibilities, and Communication

OctoAcme projects are delivered by cross-functional teams with clearly defined roles ([see Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)). **Project Managers (PMs)** coordinate delivery, manage schedules, track risks, and facilitate communication across stakeholders. **Product Managers (PdMs)** own the product vision, prioritize the backlog based on customer value, and measure success through data-driven metrics. **Developers** implement features, write tests, participate in code reviews, and help identify technical risks. **QA/Testing** validates that acceptance criteria are met and ensures quality standards are upheld. **Scrum Masters** facilitate agile ceremonies, remove impediments, and coach teams on continuous improvement. **UX/UI Designers** conduct user research and create accessible, user-centered designs. **Business Analysts** gather requirements, document processes, and ensure solutions meet business needs. **Release Managers** coordinate deployments, manage release schedules, and ensure smooth rollouts. **Support Leads** manage customer support operations, triage issues, and provide product feedback based on customer insights.

Communication is intentional and structured to maintain alignment and psychological safety ([see Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)). Teams hold daily standups to surface blockers and progress, weekly syncs between PMs and PdMs to align on priorities and risks, and monthly stakeholder updates to maintain transparency. Clear role handoffs are defined at each project phase ([see Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)) to ensure smooth transitions from requirements through design, development, testing, and release. Blocker escalation paths are clearly defined—from team-level triage to PM escalation to sponsor-level decisions—ensuring issues are resolved quickly without bottlenecks.

## Quality Assurance and Release Practices

Quality is integrated at every phase of the project lifecycle, not treated as a final gate ([see Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) and [Release & Deployment Guide](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)). Developers write unit and integration tests for new logic, and all code must pass automated tests, linting, and security scans in CI pipelines before being merged. Pull requests are kept small (ideally ≤400 lines), require at least one approval, and include clear descriptions linking to issues and acceptance criteria. Manual QA validates feature acceptance when needed, and end-to-end smoke tests verify critical flows before release. Pre-release checklists ensure that all acceptance criteria are met, release notes are drafted, rollback plans are documented, and deployments are tested in staging environments. Post-release monitoring via dashboards tracks errors, latency, and usage to catch issues early. If a deployment fails, we follow a documented incident playbook to triage, rollback if necessary, and conduct blameless retrospectives to learn and improve.

## Continuous Improvement

OctoAcme embraces a culture of continuous improvement through regular retrospectives ([see Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)). After each sprint, release, or milestone—and following incidents—teams gather to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and capture 2–3 actionable follow-ups with clear owners and due dates. These action items are tracked in the project backlog and reviewed in weekly PM syncs to ensure accountability and progress. By measuring the impact of improvements and celebrating successes, we foster psychological safety and iterative learning, ensuring that each project builds on the lessons of the last.

## Key Artifacts and Where to Find Them

Throughout the project lifecycle, teams create and maintain several key artifacts to ensure alignment and transparency:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, and timeline
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: High-level milestones and delivery schedule
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Register**: Identified risks, impact, likelihood, mitigation plans, and owners
- **Definition of Done**: Shared quality standards for work to be considered complete
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items from each iteration or milestone

These artifacts are typically stored in the project repository (in `docs/` or `.copilot/` folders) to serve as a single source of truth and enable tools like Copilot Spaces to use them as context.

## Getting Started

If you're joining an OctoAcme project, start by reviewing the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) for high-level principles and then dive into the specific process documents relevant to your role and current project phase. Our approach is designed to be lightweight, iterative, and customer-first—ensuring that every team member can contribute effectively while maintaining quality and transparency.
