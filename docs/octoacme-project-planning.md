# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Key Roles in Planning
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates sprint planning, estimation sessions, and ensures team capacity
- **Business Analyst**: Documents detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and process flows
- **UX/UI Designer**: Creates wireframes, mockups, and design specifications
- **Product Manager**: Prioritizes backlog based on business value and user needs
- **Developers**: Estimate scope, identify technical dependencies and risks
- **Project Manager**: Creates project timeline, manages dependencies, and facilitates kickoff
- **Release Manager**: Aligns project milestones with release calendar
- **Support Lead**: Reviews features for supportability and documentation needs

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected
- **Scrum Master** facilitates the planning session
- **Developers** commit to work they can complete within the sprint
- **UX/UI Designer** ensures designs are ready before development starts
- **Business Analyst** clarifies any remaining requirement questions

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
- **Project Manager** owns the Risk Register and dependency tracking
- **Business Analyst** documents integration points and data dependencies
- **Scrum Master** flags impediments during daily standups
- **Release Manager** coordinates timing with dependent teams

## Planning Checklist
- [ ] Project kickoff held (Project Manager facilitates)
- [ ] Backlog prioritized and estimated (Product Manager + Scrum Master + Developers)
- [ ] Design specifications completed (UX/UI Designer)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria documented (Business Analyst)
- [ ] Release timeline and milestones agreed (Release Manager + Project Manager)
- [ ] Definition of Done documented
- [ ] Initial test plan / QA approach drafted
- [ ] Support documentation needs identified (Support Lead)
- [ ] Cross-team dependencies mapped and owners assigned

## Handoff to Execution
- **From**: Planning team (Scrum Master, Business Analyst, UX/UI Designer)
- **To**: Development team for implementation
- **Artifacts**: Prioritized backlog, design specs, acceptance criteria, DoD, risk register
