# OctoAcme â€” Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
  - Use the Stakeholder Mapping Template from Project Initiation Guide
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status

### Communication Ownership by Role
- **Project Manager**: Overall status updates, risk escalations, stakeholder coordination
- **Product Manager**: Roadmap updates, feature priorities, success metrics
- **Scrum Master**: Sprint progress, team velocity, impediment resolution
- **Tech Lead**: Technical decisions, architecture updates, code quality metrics
- **Release Manager**: Release schedules, deployment status, post-release reports
- **Support Lead**: Customer impact summaries, incident reports, support trends
- **UX/UI Designer**: Design decisions, user research findings, usability test results
- **Business Analyst**: Requirements clarifications, process documentation, business rule changes
